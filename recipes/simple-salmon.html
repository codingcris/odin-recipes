                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Begin by patting your salmon fillet down with a paper towel. This is especially important if your fillet has skin, you want that skin to be dry so that it crisps up nicely.</li>
                    <li>Now splash the top and bottom sides of the fillet with your olive oil. Spread the oil lovingly, cover the fillet.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle your salt and pepper and the optional garlic powder on the fillet. Be generous but remember you can always add more salt, you can't take it away.</li>
                    <li>Heat up a pan over medium-high heat. Allow your pan to heat up nicely but lower the heat to medium before placing the fillet skin face down on the pan, you want the skin to crisp. </li>
                    <li>It won't take long for your salmon to cook through to the center. You can see from the sides of your salmon, as they become opaque, where the cook has reached. Also allow some time for the skin to crisp, then flip the salon.</li>
                    <li>Allow your salmon to cook to a temperature of about 145 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take. It doesn't take long. Remove from heat and serve. Pair it with the <a href="./perfect-rice.html">perfect rice</a>.</li>
                </ol>
