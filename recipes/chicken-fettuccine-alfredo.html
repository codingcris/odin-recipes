      <p class="description">
        This meal is like a red pill in the matrix. Once you realize how easy it
        is to make a homemade chicken alfredo you'll never view restaurant
        eating the same again. That's how it was for me atleast. My culinary
        journey really begins with this dish. I used to look forward to the once
        a year trips to Olive Garden for none other than this dish, and now I'm
        eating it every other day at home. It is surprisingly quick and easy,
        and is sure to be enjoyed by all.
