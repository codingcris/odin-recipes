          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Dice up your shallot. Melt your butter slowly in a your pot as you
              dice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toss your shallots into the pot, raise your heat to medium. Keep
              an eye on them as they cook, they will reach a translucent color
              when ready. About a minute or so.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toss your rice in the pot, mixing it with the shallots and
              allowing the butter to coat your whole rice. Allow it to toast for
              30 seconds to a minute.
            </li>
            <li>
              Season your rice with salt and pepper as desired. Remember that
              your chicken broth and butter may also be salted and adjust your
              salt accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Pour your chicken broth into the pot.</li>
            <li>
              Add your ground thyme to taste, a bay leaf, and your clove of
              smashed garlic. Stir your pot to mix in the spices, taste and
              adjust.
            </li>
            <li>
              By now your pot should be at or near a boil, if not don't worry,
              just wait it out. Once boiling, cover your pot of rice and bring
              the heat down all the way to low. Wait 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              At 15 minutes, your rice should be done or very near done, take a
              fork and taste. If you want a firmer rice, cook a minute or so
              less, if you want a softer rice, cook a minute or so more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve your rice and enjoy. Garnish with parsley or eat it as is,
              it's delicious either way.
